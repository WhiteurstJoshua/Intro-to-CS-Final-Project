# Intro-to-CS-Final-Project

## Overview
This project is a modified version of an earlier file sorter I developed during my DPI Apprenticeship for web development. Originally written in Ruby, the file sorter automatically moved files from the Downloads folder in File Explorer to specific locations based on file type. In this version, the project is rewritten in C++ to enhance performance and to incorporate additional functionalities like file encryption and logging.

## Features
- **File Handling:** Read and write files efficiently in C++.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt and decrypt file content using a simple XOR-based algorithm.
- **Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of file operations with timestamps.
- **Modular Design:** Separate modules for Logger, Encryption, and File Management.
